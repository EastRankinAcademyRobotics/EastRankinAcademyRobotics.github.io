Here are some resources I've found helpful so far:

# Videos

- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgv5nVbtuls) provides a good overview of the programming landscape
and talks about the 3 different approaches to programming the robot this year (pre-written code, MIT App-Inventor, and full JAVA using [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/training/index.html).

- [Video introduction](https://youtu.be/UtKbbi31PWc) to the new FTC Android Platform, which covers the basics from downloading Android Studio and ftc_sdk to writing a basic op mode for the robot.

- [Code Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/a-aXZ9bLNQA) of the FIRST(R) Tech Challenge (FTC) Robot Controller; includes some details that might be useful.

# Web

The programming resources section of the [FIRST Tech website](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc/team-resources) has links to:

- [App Inventor Download and Resources](http://frc-events.usfirst.org/2015/ftcimages)
- [Software Development Kit Download and Resources](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app)
- [Intelitek Training Resources](http://first.intelitek.com)

# Software
