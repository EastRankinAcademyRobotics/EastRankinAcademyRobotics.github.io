This week we had a 3-day JAVA programming bootcamp. We covered a basic introduction to computer science concepts,  introduced the basics of JAVA programs (keywords, operators, lines and statements, and so on), and wrote several JAVA programs together in order to get a feel for the language and what it is right to write and compile code.

# Day 1

- What is a computer
- The parts of a computer
- Hardware
- Software
- Algorithms
- Programming languages
- Your first program, “Hello World!”

# Day 2

- The parts of a basic Java program
  - Statements
  - Methods
  - Classes
  - Comments
- Coding for readability: spaces, indents, and comments
- Identifiers
- Keywords
- Capitalization matters
- Variables, assignment, and initialization
- Code examples: DisplayForecast.java, Assignments.java, useless.java

# Day 3

- Programming lab: group lab where we all wrote our first JAVA programs

A copy of the slides and all the code examples we discussed is [available on Github](https://github.com/EastRankinAcademyRobotics/java-bootcamp) in the ERA robotics repo.
